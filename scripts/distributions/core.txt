# This is an example distribution
# Text after '#' is ignored.
# Lines starting with "include " indicate what files (inside /scripts/distributions/) to load.
# Any lines that do not match are modules that should be included in the distribution.

# Here, we do not have any includes. Look at /scripts/distributions/minimal.txt for an example.

# For this distribution, we only want the most basic classes.
